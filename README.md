###Related Work

***

**GetLit! Festivals** ::: *Lead Graphics and Layouts - 2012-2013*

GetLit! is an annual literature festival funded and supported by Eastern, and the Spokane community. I held a 6 month internship at their offices.
The main part of my internship was to prepare a 30 page insert for the Inlander. The insert contained all of the festival information, and descriptions
of each special guest. In addition, I also prepared three ad series that were printed in the Inlander, as well as the Seattle Weekly. This internship
provided me with exposure to large print platforms, as well as great experience working with a team.

**ufeonline.org** ::: *Webmaster, VPS Server Manager - 2012-Present*

ufeonline.org is the website for the United Faculty of Eastern. As of late 2012, I have been the webmaster for their website, and have been tasked with
updating content, controlling email, and managing their server. As soon as I was hired, they migrated from a Shared Hosting service to a VPS server, and 
it was my responsibility to manage and run the server. This job has provided me with a glimpse at industry web design, and allows me to work at my pace.
