###Related Work

**GetLit! Festivals** ::: *Lead Graphics and Layouts - 2012-2013*

GetLit! is an annual literature festival funded and supported by Eastern, and the Spokane community. I held a 6 month internship at their offices.
The main part of my internship was to prepare a 30 page insert for the Inlander. The insert contained all of the festival information, and descriptions
of each special guest. In addition, I also prepared three ad series that were printed in the Inlander, as well as the Seattle Weekly. This internship
provided me with exposure to large print platforms, as well as great experience working with a team.
